# Dynasty8 - Real Estate Management Application
Dynasty8 is a real estate management application developed using React for the frontend and Spring Boot for the backend. The frontend is built with React to manage the user interface and Material-UI for styling. On the backend, Spring Boot is used to create RESTful APIs, with JPA/Hibernate for object-relational mapping and PostgreSQL as the database. Authentication and authorization are handled through Spring Security and JWT. The application facilitates management of real estate portfolios and apartments, offering features like creation, viewing, editing, and deletion of properties.
